# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this we have built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Usage

This application allows the user to:

- _Add departments, roles, employees_

- _View departments, roles, employees_

- _Update employee roles_

Future Development:

- Update employee managers

- View employees by manager

- Delete departments and roles

- View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

- Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

- Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

- Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

- Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

- Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

- Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

- The URL of the GitHub repository

- A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality
