# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this we have built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Usage

This application allows the user to:

- _Add departments, roles, employees_

- _View departments, roles, employees_

- _Update employee roles_

Future Development:

- Update employee managers

- View employees by manager

- Delete departments and roles

- View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
